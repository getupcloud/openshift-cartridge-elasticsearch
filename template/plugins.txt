## Edit this file, commit and push. All plugins will be
## installed inside all gears.

##
## To install a plugin from a zip file, simply place the file inside dir

## Configuration is build on-the-fly with initial contents from file

## same dir (except for logging.yml and elasticsearch.in.sh). Files ending with
## .erb will be pre-processed using ruby's erb command.
